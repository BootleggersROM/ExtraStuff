# ExtraStuff - Documentation and assets

We have the following files here, which is free for the users to do whatever they want. From wallpapers to... well, the sky is the limit. Have fun with it.


### Directories

**docs:** All our documentation is here. Will get more updates in the future. You can find the following:

**images:** Assets we use for branding and some large size images for using as wallpapers or for blog posts/thumbnails.

**logos:** Vectorized assets we've been using throughout the years. From logos used in our releases, to theme logos and unused designs made for Bootleggers.
