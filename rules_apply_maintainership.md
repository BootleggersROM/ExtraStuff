# Maintainer Rules for Bootleggers ROM

This set of rules are required to be considered before applying for maintainership for Bootleggers. Please, take the time to read them before applying.

### Device trees

- **All the trees should be posted and public on Github/Gitlab.** At the time of applying, we compare them with different other repos from other developers/projects to check if things like authorship and commit history are on point. 
- **Sources should not have more than 3 (three) branches with other Custom ROM projects.** As we like to have people building and sharing the great work of other projects, we need dedicated people who might want to test some new things or check if everything is a point, not buildbots who are constantly making 68 builds for the sake of a developer title.
- **Respect authorship and make your forks.** Having your custom device tree guarantees that if something is broken, you can fix it fast. Dumb thing to clarify at this point. So, it's better if you do your forks with the whole adapting to our ROM instead of linking us some Lineage/Other developer trees (the only exception to this rule is kernel/vendor trees that requires little to no changes most of the time) that you used to build. Also, sources without proper commit authorship or "Initial commit" (the 1 commit magic device tree) sources will be completely ignored.
- **The private trees rule:** Private trees are accepted but with the limit of 1 (one) months since the maintainer application is accepted. A private tree is tolerated if the device is having a lot of bugs and it needs some big changes to make it stable. If it's private to the sake of being private or "i don't want buildbot to leech me" then after the month, your device will be dropped.
