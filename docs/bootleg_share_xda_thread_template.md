[B]Bootleggers ROM[/B] is an aftermarket firmware based on AOSP with some patches and fixes from LineageOS and various other projects. The idea is to bring custom features and some of the most useful apps to your device, with the goal of [B]Making you feel like å®¶[/B].

With an almost stable source, this ROM is also packed with some custom wallpapers (available on the system wallpaper app), ringtones, fonts, and themes to bring your device a fresh look and give you always a good experience.
