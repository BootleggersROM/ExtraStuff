[CENTER][IMG="FAQ Section"]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BootleggersROM/ExtraStuff/master/threadfiles/05-faq.png[/IMG]

Here's some small answer to your questions or just answer to questions.

[CODE]
Q: Bootleggers? Why?
A: Because Bootleg is something not original, or a fake copy, so, we're not being so original here... That's why we're bootleggers. 

Q: What does the chinese/japanese thing means? I don't get it
A: According to google (and take the meaning of this with a hundred quotation marks) it means home or family. We want you to use your phone and feel yourself comfortable, and like it, like you'll be at home.

Q: Can i make Bootleggers stuff like wallpapers, logos and stuff?
A: Of course, feel free to do it, we will love it. 

Q: Do you have any Telegram/G+ Group to chat and share stuff of the ROM?
A: Not yet but if case many people request it, sure we'll do it[/CODE]
